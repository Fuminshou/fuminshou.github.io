I’m a retired Pokèmon Master with over 20 years of experience, the worst snowboarder in all Europe, a conference speaker, and a carbs lover.

I help people work happier: I’m a digital transformation consultant and a community manager who believes that a passionate and involved team member brings better results faster.

I’m the founder of [PUG Romagna](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/PUG-Romagna-PHP-User-Group-Romagnolo/) and [devRomagna](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/DevRomagna/), two communities of IT people for IT people, aim to spread knowledge and best practices.
